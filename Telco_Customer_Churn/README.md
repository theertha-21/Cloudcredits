## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Problem Statement
Understanding which features influence customer churn to reduce the churn rate.

### 2. Data Acquisition
- Imported the dataset from a CSV file.
- Inspected columns, datatypes, and structure.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values
- Converted data types
- Encoded categorical features
- Removed irrelevant columns

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Used visual tools like bar plots, histograms, box plots
- Analyzed relationships between variables
- Identified high-risk churn groups

### 5. Insights & Interpretation
- Senior citizens, fiber optic users, and month-to-month contract users show higher churn rates
- Longer contract terms correlate with lower churn
